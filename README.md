# Online Courses

In this repository I'll keep all the code I create for online courses I take (mostly in the form of Jupyter Notebooks).

**Note:** I'll only opload stuff I create. I won't post other people's content.

## Structure:

Each folder corresponds to a different course; each with it's own requirements file if necessary.
