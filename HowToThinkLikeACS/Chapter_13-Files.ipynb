    "While a program is running, its data gets stored in **random access memory (RAM)**, which is fast, inexpensive, and **volatile**, meaning that when the program ends or the computer is shut down, it dissappears. In order to make your data available for the next session, you need to store it in a **non-volatile** medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-volatile media store items in objects called **files**, which you can **read** (access data already contained in a pre-existing file) and **write** (create a new file). These files are organized using a set of rules, known as a **file system**, which are collections of files and **directories** (containers for files and other directories).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Paths and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "A **path** is the name of the directory where the file is located. There are two tyes of paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relative path:** Path to files within the directory in which you're currently working.\n",
    "* **Absolute path:** Path from the system's **root** (default) directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Unix-based operating systems, paths are written by delimiting directory and filenames with a forward slash(`/`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root/MyFiles/SubDir_1/SubDir_2/script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, paths are usually written using double backslashes (`\\\\`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "root/MyFiles/SubDir_1/SubDir_2/script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A neat trick with Python is that the `os` library handles writing the correct delimiters for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "os.path.join(path, path_1, path_2, ...)\n",

    "##  Handles for modifying files\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for writing a file is to create a **handle** for the file. This is the object that will be called to make changes to the actual file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, handles are created with the `open` function, which receives two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. file: String with the file to be accessed, including the path (either absolute or relative) and extention.\n",
    "2. mode: String with what you want to do to the file. FOr example, `\"r\"` allows you to read a file, whereas `\"w\"` allows you to write it, and `\"x\"` is used to edit it. If the file is binary (zip, executables, images, etc.) you need to add a `b` at the end of the mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<name> = open(\"<file_path + file_name + . + file_extension>\", \"<mode>\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "however, the following is prefered:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "with open(\"<file_path + file_name + . + file_extension>\", \"<mode>\") as <name>:\n",
    "    <do something>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "because it handles errors for you if something goes wrong, and doesn't require you to close the files explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handle methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most usual handle methods you'll use in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `write(string)`: Writes the string into the file, as long as it was accessed in write mode.\n",
    "* `readline()`: Read the next line in the file, as long as it was accessed in read mode (it remembers for you which line it's currently at).\n",
    "* `readlines()`: Read all lines into a list.\n",
    "* `read()`: Read the entire file at once, provided it was accessed in read mode.\n",
    "* `close()`: Save progress and stop editing the file.\n",
    "\n",
