    "# Chapter 5: Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows us to change the program behaviour depending on whether certain conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boolean Values and Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Boolean value** is either _true_ or _false_. The name comes from British mathemathician George Boole, who first formulated rules for reasoning and operating with these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pyhton a true value is represented by the `True` token, and false is represented with `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Boolean expression** is an expression whose evaluation results in a Boolean value. They are obtained by using **Boolean operators**, which are tokens that indicate that the expression is Boolean. For example, there are 6 common **comparison operators**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Equality (`==`): Indicates whether two variables have the same value.\n",
    "2. Inequality (`!=`): Indicates whether two variables have different values.\n",
    "3. Greater than (`>`): Indicates whether a value is strictly greater than another.\n",
    "4. Less than (`<`): Indicates whether a value is strictly lower than another.\n",
    "5. Greater or equal than (`>=`): Indicates whether a value is greater or equal to another.\n",
    "6. Less or equal than (`<=`): Indicates whether a value is lower or equal to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python you can assign Boolean values to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has **logical operators**, which allow us to combine Boolean expressions.  There are the following 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `not (<expression>)`: Evaluates to `True` iff `<expression>` evaluates to `False`. \n",
    "2. `(<expression 1>) and (<expression 2>)`: Evaluates to `True` iff both expressions evaluate to `True`.\n",
    "3. `(<expression 1>) or (<expression 2>)`: Evaluates to `True` iff at least one of the expressions evaluate to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators also allow us to **short-circuit evaluations**, meaning that a part of the evaluations isn't performed if it's not necessary. For example, Python won't evaluate the `a > b` expression in\n",
    "\n",
    "`(1 < 0) and (a > b)`\n",
    "\n",
    "because `1 < 0` evaluates to `False`, and thus the result of the entire expression will be `False`, regardless of the second expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplyfying the Not operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Some statements usig the `not` operator can be difficult to read. In many cases they can be simplified by performing the negation instead of negating the statement. In order to accomplish this, you need to understand the **logical opposites** of operators, this is statements that have the exact same meaning than a negation. Here are the logical opposites of the operators we've studied so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "|**operator**|**logical opposite**|\n",
    "|------------|:------------------:|\n",
    "| `==` | `!=` |\n",
    "| `!=` | `==` |\n",
    "| `<` | `>=` |\n",
    "| `<=` | `>` |\n",
    "| `>` | `<=` |\n",
    "| `>=` | `<` |\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful tool to perform negations are the **de Morgan's Laws**, which allow us to distribute negations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\mbox{not} (a \\mbox{and} b) = (\\mbox{not} a) \\mbox{or} (\\mbox{not} b)$\n",
    "2. $\\mbox{not} (a \\mbox{or} b) = (\\mbox{not} a) \\mbox{and} (\\mbox{not} b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional execution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional statements** are statements that allow us to change the behabiour of programs depending on which conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If\n",
    "\n",
    "Executes a sequence of statements if a conditon is met It's structure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if <condition>:\n",
    "    <statements when condition is True>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### If - Else\n",
    "\n",
    "Executes a sequence of statements if a condition is met. If it isn't, it executes a different set. It has the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if <condition>:\n",
    "    <statements when condition is True>\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    <statements when condition is False>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chained Conditionals (If - Elif - Else)\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are multiple possibilities, we can use **chained conditionals**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if <condition 1>:\n",
    "    <statements when condition 1 is True>\n",
    "elif <condition 2>:\n",
    "    <statements when condition 1 is False and condition 2 is True>\n",
    "...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    <statements when none of the conditions were met>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Conditionals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested conditionals** are conditionals within conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if <condition>:\n",
    "    <statements when condition is True>\n",
    "    if <sub - condition 2>:\n",
    "        <statements when condition is True and sub - condition is True>\n",
    "    <more statements when condition is True>\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    <statements when condition is False>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that nested conditionals can be hard to read. As a general rule, it's preferable to use logical operators and chained conditonals if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pass Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, each **block** after an `if`, `elif` or `else` clause must have at least one statement. When we don't want to perform any action, we use the`pass` statement, which means \"if this condition is met, do nothing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Return Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter we mentioned that fruitful functions will stop executing when they find a `return` statement. This means that we can change when a function stops executing with conditional statements and `return`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following function will not execute the last part when it receives an even number:"
