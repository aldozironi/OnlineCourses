    "In an earlier chapter we saw two turtle methods, hideturtle and showturtle that can hide or show a turtle. This suggests that we could take a different approach to the traffic lights program. Add to your program above as follows: draw a second housing for another set of traffic lights. Create three separate turtles to represent each of the green, orange and red lights, and position them appropriately within your new housing. As your state changes occur, just make one of the three turtles visible at any time. Once you’ve made the changes, sit back and ponder some deep thoughts: you’ve now got two different ways to use turtles to simulate the traffic lights, and both seem to work. Is one approach somehow preferable to the other? Which one more closely resembles reality — i.e. the traffic lights in your town?"

Modify the program now so that the lights don’t disappear: they are either on, or off. But when they’re off, they’re still visible."

The machine should spend 3 seconds in the Green state, followed by one second in the Green+Orange state, then one second in the Orange state, and then 2 seconds in the Red state.
