    "3. **Built-in**: all the identifiers built into Python, like the `sum`, `len`, and `range` functions we've used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope Lookup Rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's stop to think further about our previous example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We defined `n` in the global scope.\n",
    "2. We created a new variable, `n` in a local scope.\n",
    "3. When we access the variable `n` within the local scope, it uses the value in the local scope.\n",
    "4. When we access the global `n`, the local variable no longer exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we've made a temporal alias of the variable `n`! This would seem to imply that the lookup happens in the scope you're in; but as we mentioned, the built-in scope contains some functions we've used without importing them to the global scope. What gives? Python has a set of rules on **how** to look for variables in the different scopes. They are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python will always look for names in the smallest (most local) scope available.\n",
    "2. If Python doesn't find the name in that scope, it will look for it in whatever scope contains said scope. $^*$\n",
    "3. Python will repeat the step 2 until one of two things happens: if Python finds the name, it will use it and stop iterating (it will use the name in the most local scope it can find the name); if Python reaches the built-in scope and doesn't find the name there, it will raise a NameError.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Lookup rules imply that you can redefine built-in functions if you want, though you generally should avoid doing it because it can lead to confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you define the function `f` within the function `g` and you try to access a name inside the function `f`, Python will first look for the name in the scope of `f`. If it doesn't find it, it looks for it in the **enveloping** scope (that of `g`). If Python hasn't found it yet, it will look in the global scope and finally in the built-in scope. In code:\n",
